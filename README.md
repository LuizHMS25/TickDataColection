# TickDataColection

Project inspired by https://github.com/andpena/FinancialData

The code obtains the data from a RTD connection created by the Tryd Home Broker and inserts into a Time Series Database (QuestDB).

This allows the creation of a tick-by-tick database with order execution information.
